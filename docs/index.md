## Overview

pyCirclize is a circular visualization python package implemented based on matplotlib.
This package is developed for the purpose of easily and beautifully plotting circular figure such as Circos Plot and Chord Diagram in Python.
In addition, useful genome and phylogenetic tree visualization methods for the bioinformatics field are also implemented.
pyCirclize was inspired by [circlize](https://github.com/jokergoo/circlize) and [pyCircos](https://github.com/ponnhide/pyCircos).
